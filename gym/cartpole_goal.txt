A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart. The goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible. Return one value in range [-1,1] for this image to indicate the reward for it, higher value means closer to optimal.
